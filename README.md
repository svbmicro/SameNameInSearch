# Objects with the same name in search

I think everybody is checking for the objects of the same name in MSTR or search work like on the screenshot.  
![Same name](https://github.com/svbmicro/SameNameInSearch/blob/master/Samename.PNG)

I made sure that it is not so and I must create a check script.

There are two scripts in the repository 
* procedure.java - java code for command manager, 
* oracle.sql - if you have access to metadatabase
