# Objects with same name in search

I think everebody are checking for the same names objects or MSTR search work like on screenshot.
![Same name](https://github.com/svbmicro/SameNameInSearch/blob/master/Samename.PNG)

Starting a new project I made sure that it is not so and I must create checking script.

There are two scripts in repository. 
procedure.java - java code for command manager 
query.sql - if you have access to meta database
